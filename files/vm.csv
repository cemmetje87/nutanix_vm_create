#  ip            => VM's IP address
#  subnet_name   => VM's subnet
#  image_name    => Name of the disk image used to create the VM
#  num_vcpu      => Number of vCPU sockets for the VM
#  memory_mib    => VM's memory size in MiB
#  disk_list_mib => Additional VM disk sizes in MiB (hyphen-separated)
#
#  NOTE:
